# Blog::Sniffer

It allows you to fetch information from all engineering blog posts from 
[this list](https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs)
and save it in a database for further analysis.

## Why?

I was just building a small fuzzy finder to get urls from blog content to easily
access content while I'm learning about Timescale.

I'd like to have a fuzzy finder to easy find [posts](https://blog.timescale.com)
or [docs](https://docs.timescale.com) from timescale. Validating if all internal
links are working and so on...

Then, I thought...

1. I'm getting more deep on technical writing and my objective is better understand the
industry language and the jargons. I'd like to play with this data and have fun
with statistics related to text writing.

2. I'm also very interested in data science and I'd like to explore all the data in different ways.

3. I'm benchmarking the smallest instance that [forge](https://www.timescale.com/forge) can offer :wink:.

## Installation

It's not a rubygem yet, so you need to clone and install locally:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:jonatas/blog-sniffer.git
cd blog-sniffer
bundle install
```

Setup your micro instance on [Timescale for free](https://www.timescale.com/timescale-signup).
Then you can configure your PG_URI through your favorite manner to have access
to the environment variable. 

```
export PG_URI="postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/tsdb?sslmode=require"
```

I try to use [direnv](https://direnv.net) make my life easier and safe.
So, I can drop my secrets into a `.envrc` and it will be available only in this directory:

```bash
echo 'export PG_URI="postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/tsdb?sslmode=require"' >> .envrc
direnv allow
```

Then you can use `bin/blog-sniffer *<urls>` to start crawling or simply take
over the world!

```bash
bin/blog-sniffer
```

It will sniff all websites over [lib/blog/target_sites](lib/blog/target_sites.rb) that is fetching everything
from this [repo](https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs). To run over all repo list it took over 24 hours to me.

Around 200k pages.

You can open and run parallel process and it will keep expanding and fetching
more URLs. The modem of my house got stuck after hours parallelizing 10 process,
but it uses a low band and memory.

A few tabs in parallel is enough. In 10+ hours I got 32k pages downloaded.

So, let's explain this journey using SQL, so, you can better understand the
results.

## State of art

I downloaded `228849` pages in `19 hours` from my home :)

```sql
 SELECT MIN(time) AS start,
   MAX(time) AS end,
   COUNT(1) AS total_pages,
   EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM(MAX(time) - MIN(time)) / 3600)::INTEGER AS hours_of_adventure
   FROM pages;
            start             |              end              | total_pages | hours_of_adventure
------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------+--------------------
 2021-05-05 19:05:43.54879+00 | 2021-05-06 14:05:51.156821+00 |      228849 |                 19
```

But, I haven't worked all the day and have paused it for several hours, so,
let's have a look on the total pages downloaded per hour.

I'll use [time_bucket](https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/analytics/time_bucket/) function.

```sql
 SELECT time_bucket('1 hour', time) AS hour,
   COUNT(1) AS total_pages,
   pg_size_pretty(SUM(html_size)) AS bandwidth
   FROM pages
   GROUP BY 1;
          hour          | total_pages | bandwidth

If you clicked in the link before, maybe you would like to get to know more
about `time_bucket` and build an amazing query for it:

```sql
SELECT url FROM pages WHERE title ~ 'time_bucket';
                                               url
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/analytics/time_bucket/
 https://docs.timescale.com/api/latest/analytics/time_bucket_gapfill/
 https://blog.timescale.com/blog/simplified-time-series-analytics-using-the-time_bucket-function/
(3 rows)
```

## Where the information comes from?

Counting pages per host. Extracting domain would be a bit more complicated, but
here we can have a good overview of the most richful sources.

```sql
SELECT SPLIT_PART(url,'/',3) as host, COUNT(1) FROM pages GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 10;
       host              | count
-------------------------+-------

```

## Getting familiar with the Postgresql Text Search Controls

Getting a ranked titles using [text search controls](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/textsearch-controls.html).

```sql
SELECT title, ts_rank_cd(to_tsvector(title), query) AS rank
FROM pages, to_tsquery('petabyte+scale') query
WHERE query @@ to_tsvector(title)
ORDER BY rank DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Now let's wrap it on a function, that was one of my objectives:
```sql
CREATE TYPE ranked_post AS (title text, url text, rank real);

CREATE FUNCTION get_ranked_posts(text, integer default 5) RETURNS setof ranked_post
  AS $$
    SELECT title, url, ts_rank_cd(to_tsvector(title), query) AS rank
    FROM pages, to_tsquery($1) query
    WHERE query @@ to_tsvector(title)
    ORDER BY rank DESC
    LIMIT $2;
$$
LANGUAGE SQL;
```

Trying it:

```sql
select rank, title from get_ranked_posts('postgresql+scaling');
 rank |                   title
------+--------------------------------------------
  0.1 | How to Scale PostgreSQL 10
 0.05 | Upgrading PostgreSQL At Scale - 5 min read
 ...
```

Testing a different subject with another limit:

```sql
select rank, url from get_ranked_posts('Analytical+Platform',7) ;
 rank |                                                             url
------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(7 rows)
```

Some results are still repeated as I didn't have the proper time to normalize
all the urls before fetch it. Feel free to contribute :raised_hands:

Let's check the worst scenarios we had fetching the data from websites:

```sql
SELECl SPLIT_PART(url,'/',3) AS domain, AVG(time_to_fetch) FROM pages GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC LIMIT 10;
               domain                |        avg

## Slowest websites

## Usage

Check [bin/blog-sniffer](bin/blog-sniffer) to get more details in a massive
crawling system, but the basics are:

Run `bin/console` to get the classes loaded into a pry session:

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> spider = Blog::Sniffer::EngineeringDocs.new(root: "https://blog.timescale.com")
=> #<Blog::Sniffer::EngineeringDocs:0x00007fcdbc26dae0 @root="https://blog.timescale.com">
[2] pry(main)> spider.results.lazy.take(1).first
Handling  : "https://blog.timescale.com"
=> {:title=>"Timescale Blog",
 :headers=>
  ["$40 million to help developers measure everything that matters",
   "Timescale Newsletter Roundup: March 2021 Edition", ....],

   ["Log into Timescale Forge"]=>"https://console.forge.timescale.com/",

 :html_size=>135963,
 :time_to_fetch=>2.063971000025049,
 :url=>"https://blog.timescale.com"}
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies.

It does not contain any spec as I wrote it as a POC. Feel free to contribute and
add them ;)
